## Overview

This is a great app for everyone who loves to meetup and wants to join a community of users to find new things to do. Users can sign up if they do not have an account, or sign in via Facebook. Once logged in, a user has access to an existing library of Meetups or they can create their own new meetups. Users can also look at the Meetups by a particular day they want to go.
